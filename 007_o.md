# o

`o` (and `O`) are so useful...

They're analogous to `<shift-enter>` and `<control-enter>` in some other editors.

Often you're in normal mode and you want to begin typing on a new line below the current one or above the current one.

This is very common, particularly as your become vimmier and spend more time in normal mode than insert mode.

- `o` (lower case "oh") will add a new line below the current line and put you into insert mode.
- `O` (upper case "oh") will do the same but add one above

# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Complete Rimmer's intepretation of events from Red Dwarf's "Thanks for the Memory":

- move your cursor to anywhere on the third line: "They do it below the knee"
- do `o`
- type `Lo.` then hit escape
- move your cursor to anywhere on the line: "They do it twice - twice"
- do `o`
- type `Two.` then hit escape

```
Breaking your leg hurts like hell, OK?
Hel.
They do it below the knee
"Hel-lo" Get it?
They do it twice - twice,
"Hello two."
And the jigsaw must mean "you."
"Hello to you."
```

I wouldn't like to be around when one of these suckers is making a speech!

## Exercise 2

We'll fix the same block of text but this time from bottom up.

- move your cursor to anywhere on the line: "Hellow two"
- do `O`
- type `Two.` then hit escape
- move your cursor to anywhere on the line: "Hel-lo" Get it?
- do `O`
- type `Lo.` then hit escape

```
Breaking your leg hurts like hell, OK?
Hel.
They do it below the knee
"Hel-lo" Get it?
They do it twice - twice,
"Hello two."
And the jigsaw must mean "you."
"Hello to you."
```

# vim-unimpaired

Tim Pope has a plugin "vim-unimpaired" which adds operators for adding a new blank line above/below the current line
without moving your cursor or going into insert mode.

This is surprisingly useful when prettying up code. Much cleaner than doing `o<escape>k` which I often find myself doing.

It also has operators for swapping the current line with the one above below which is also useful in the context of juggling blank lines.
